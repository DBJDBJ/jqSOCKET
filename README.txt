With jQuery 1.4.1  this works as before, after moving to jQ 1.9.1 moreSelectors.js has issues:

1.
"[~right]" has to be changed to "[~ right]" to work
2.
All the other attr prefixes are not tested
jqunit testebed has to be done


Public testbed is here: http://dbj.org/6/jqplug
listable: http://dbj.org/6/index.php?dir=jqplug%2F

Long explanation, FOR PUBLIC, will be here:
